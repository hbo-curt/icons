		<p>It was the best of times,</p>
		<p>it was the worst of times,</p>
		<p>it was the age of wisdom,</p>
		<p>it was the age of foolishness,</p>
		<p>it was the epoch of belief,</p>
		<p>it was the epoch of incredulity,</p>
		<p>it was the season of Light,</p>
		<p>it was the season of Darkness,</p>
		<p>it was the spring of hope,</p>
		<p>it was the winter of despair,</p>
		<p>we had everything before us,</p>
		<p>we had nothing before us,</p>
		<p>we were all going direct to Heaven,</p>
		<p>we were all going direct the other way--</p>
		<p>in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of</p>
		<p>its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for</p>
		<p>evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.</p>
